# Mathematics for Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my notes and exercises on the mathematical foundations
required for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The focus is on understanding concepts rigorously and building intuition,
rather than memorizing formulas.

## Topics Covered
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Probability and Statistics
- Optimization (later)

Each topic includes:
- Written explanations in Markdown
- Simple Python scripts where useful
- Clear structure and gradual progression

## Purpose
This repository is part of my academic preparation for a Bachelor's degree in
Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on strong theoretical foundations.
