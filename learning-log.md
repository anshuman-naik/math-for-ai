## 25 February

- Initialized mathematics repository for AI
- Documented foundational ideas in calculus
- Focused on intuition before formal definitions

## 26 February
- Began probability section
- Wrote basic probability terminology and concepts

Key realization:
Linear algebra, calculus, and probability form the core mathematical foundation of AI. Building them slowly and clearly is more valuable than rushing into projects.

# 📘 Learning Log — 27 February 2026

## Focus Areas
- Conceptual Revision  
- Vector Space Extensions into Probabilistic Frameworks  
- Project Planning: Linear Regression Implementation (Python + Matplotlib)

---

## 1. Revision
Revisited previously covered material in:
- Linear Algebra (vector operations, linear combinations)
- Probability fundamentals

Clarified connections between vector spaces and probabilistic representations.

---

## 2. Extending Vectors into Probability

Explored how:
- Random variables can be viewed as elements in vector spaces  
- Expectation acts as a linear operator  
- Variance relates to inner-product structure  

Connected:
- Vector representation → Feature space  
- Probability distributions → Data representation  

This establishes foundational understanding for statistical learning models.

---

## 3. Linear Regression Project Planning

Designed implementation roadmap for:

- Simple Linear Regression from scratch
- Python implementation (NumPy for computation)
- Visualization using Matplotlib
- Plotting regression line against dataset
- Computing Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Defined next steps:
- Implement regression model using either:
  - Gradient Descent, or  
  - Normal Equation  
- Begin implementation on 28 February 2026

## Reflection
Today focused on conceptual consolidation and project structuring rather than intensive problem-solving. The transition from pure mathematics (vectors, probability) toward applied machine learning (regression modeling) is becoming structurally clear.

## Current Focus

- Strengthen conceptual clarity
- Maintain consistent daily progress
- Prioritize understanding over speed
