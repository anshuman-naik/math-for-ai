# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a core mathematical foundation of artificial intelligence
and machine learning. It provides the framework used to represent data,
model parameters, and transformations between spaces.

This section focuses on building intuition first, followed by formal
definitions and applications relevant to AI.

## Scope
The topics covered here are selected based on their importance in machine
learning and optimization.

Planned topics include:
- Scalars, vectors, and vector spaces
- Vector operations and geometric interpretation
- Dot product and norms
- Matrices and matrix multiplication
- Linear transformations
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

## Approach
- Concepts are introduced gradually
- Emphasis is placed on understanding meaning, not memorization
- Simple examples are preferred over abstract generalization
- Mathematical notation is introduced only when necessary

Each concept is documented in a separate file and expanded as understanding
deepens.
