# Calculus

Calculus provides the mathematical tools used to describe change and
optimization. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, calculus is
essential for understanding learning algorithms, loss functions, and model
training.

This section focuses on building intuition before formal techniques, with an
emphasis on concepts that directly appear in machine learning.

## Scope
Planned topics include:
- Limits and continuity
- Derivatives and their interpretation
- Partial derivatives
- Gradients and optimization
- Basic ideas of integrals (as accumulation)

## Approach
- Concepts are introduced intuitively first
- Graphical interpretation is emphasized
- Formal definitions are added only when necessary
- Connections to optimization and learning algorithms are highlighted

Each concept is documented in a separate file and expanded progressively.
