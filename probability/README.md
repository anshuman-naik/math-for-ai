# Probability

Probability provides the mathematical framework for reasoning under
uncertainty. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, uncertainty
is unavoidable — whether in data, predictions, or model assumptions.

This section focuses on building conceptual clarity before introducing
formal probability theory.

## Scope
Planned topics include:
- Basic terminology (experiments, outcomes, events)
- Sample spaces
- Random variables
- Probability distributions
- Expectation and variance
- Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem

## Relevance to AI
Probability is essential in AI because:
- Data is inherently noisy
- Predictions involve uncertainty
- Many models are probabilistic
- Learning often involves estimating distributions

The goal is to understand probability as a language for uncertainty,
not just as a collection of formulas.
