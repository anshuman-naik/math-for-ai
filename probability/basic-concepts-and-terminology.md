# Basic Concepts and Terminology

Probability begins with understanding experiments and uncertainty.

## Random Experiment
A random experiment is a process whose outcome cannot be predicted
with certainty in advance.

Example:
Tossing a coin or rolling a die.

## Outcome
An outcome is a single possible result of a random experiment.

Example:
When rolling a die, getting a 3 is one outcome.

## Sample Space
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

For a fair six-sided die:
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

## Event
An event is a subset of the sample space.
It represents one or more outcomes of interest.

Example:
Getting an even number when rolling a die.
Event = {2, 4, 6}

## Probability (Intuition)
Probability measures how likely an event is to occur.

For equally likely outcomes:

Probability of an event =
(Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)

## Why This Matters in Machine Learning

In machine learning:
- Data generation can be viewed as a random process
- Predictions can be interpreted probabilistically
- Uncertainty must be quantified to make reliable decisions

Understanding these basic concepts is necessary before studying
distributions, expectation, and Bayesian reasoning.
